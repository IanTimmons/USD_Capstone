# USD_Capstone

This is the project directory for University of San Diego 

## Getting Started
Clone the GitHub Repo from:
https://github.com/goal2002man/USD_Capstone

Create a temporary environment for this project:
conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9

To view available environments:
conda env list

To activate the environment:
conda activate <env_name>

Load environment dependencies from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

To update the requirements file use the following:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

After cloning the repository create a new branch off of main:
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

To get code back to github repository I personally use the VS Code Github module. 
But this can also be done via command line:
git commit -m "<enter message about commit here>"
git push
